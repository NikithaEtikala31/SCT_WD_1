🌐 Built a responsive multi-section Portfolio Website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This landing page showcases a clean, modern design with smooth scrolling and a sticky navigation bar. Each section — Home, About, Services, and Contact — is elegantly designed for readability and engagement.

💡 Highlights:

Fixed responsive navigation with scroll effect ✨

Background overlay and high-res images for aesthetic depth 📸

Fully responsive layout (mobile-friendly) 📱

Lightweight and fast — no external libraries used ⚡

🛠️ This project deepened my understanding of pure frontend development — especially DOM interactions and responsive styling.
